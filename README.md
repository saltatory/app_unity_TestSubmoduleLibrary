Unity + Git Demonstration Project
=================================

This project demonstrates a sample project layout for Unity using Git. Specifically, it uses Git submodules to organize shared components.

# Checkout and Run

* Checkout by `git clone <url> --recursive`. This will fetch the submodules as well.
* Open in Unity and run!

# Directory Structure

Assets and libraries may be externally developed either internally by other teams or externally by other companies. These libraries should be cloned as Git Submodules under `Assets/Libraries`. 

For example, the Test library is stored in `Assets/Libraries/lib_unity_Test`.
